Game idea: Dig a Hole
User digs x spaces in (+/-)x or (-)y direction.
x is a roll of a d6
if user hits a chance block, the dice changes to a d-4,6,8,10,12,20 or loose a turn (varried chance to get each result
show progress with a table:
----@-----
------*---
----------
---*------
-*-----*--

@ is the user, * is a chance block, - is dirt

goal is to make it to the bottom in as few rolls/moves as possible
